I tried to use CoSb3 as an example to illustrate the coordination, but 
it is not successful. The CoSb3 octahedra has a perfect regular coordination and 
it is not possible to train any equivariant network to obtain a desired mapping

This is still a problem I face. One way to get around it is to randomly displace it a bit from 
octahedra, but then the network will basically learn the effect of these random displacement,
