# TODO List:
### Discipline
1. boy scout rule: leave your play ground better than you found it.
1. Always keep acceptance test pass 

### AutomaticTB Codebase
 - [x] Improve the flat band solution and unify band structure plot
 - [x] debug the boltztrap solution, *now boltztrap class should be clean to work with*
 - [x] write test outside of `src`
 - [x] Branching, add support for n orbital number
 - [x] fully support the orbital n-number
 - [x] Added combined equation solver
 - [ ] Undate acceptance tests
 - [ ] add value unfolding and interface to tightbinding for the combined equation solver
        (this means change the interface between tightbinding and equation system)
 - [ ] change printAO to use structure, instead of cluster
 - [ ] add cluster Hamiltonian and solver
 - [ ] Si, tight-binding model

### Rule for writting tests
- use single folders to collect tests into independent sections
