# TODO List:
### Theory
 - [ ] How to understand second nearest neighbor interaction? it is related to the overlap matrix

### AutomaticTB Codebase
 - [x] Improve the flat band solution and unify band structure plot
 - [x] debug the boltztrap solution, *now boltztrap class should be clean to work with*
 - [x] write test outside of `src`
 - [ ] Branching, add support for n orbital number
 - [ ] Si, tight-binding model
 - [ ] 

### Rule for writting tests
- use single folders to collect tests into independent sections
