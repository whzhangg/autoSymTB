"""
This module provide method to plot wavefunction from a given structure. It is designed to be large 
independent from the other modules by providing functions as interface. 
It's main functionality is two:
1. plot cluster molecular wavefunction given a linear combination
2. plot molecular wavefunction in solids

TODO List:
- [ ] Add interface to plot the orbital density in solids
