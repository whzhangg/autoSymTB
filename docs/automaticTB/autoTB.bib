	abstract = {A computer algorithm to search crystal symmetries of crystal structures has been implemented in software \${\textbackslash}texttt\{spglib\}\$. An iterative algorithm is employed to find a set of space group operations that belongs to any one of space group types by accepting certain amount of distortion for input unit cell structures. The source code is distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License that is a permissive free software licence. Although \${\textbackslash}texttt\{spglib\}\$ is a small code, the iteration loops made the source code complicated. The aim of this text is to provide the algorithm details to those people who are interested in inside-\${\textbackslash}texttt\{spglib\}\$. This text is written for \${\textbackslash}texttt\{spglib\}\$ v1.10.4.},

	abstract = {Automatic detection of point groups as well as symmetrisation of molecular geometry and wavefunctions are useful tools in computational quantum chemistry. Algorithms for developing these tools as well as an implementation are presented. The symmetry detection algorithm is a clustering algorithm for symmetry invariant properties, combined with logical deduction of possible symmetry elements using the geometry of sets of symmetrically equivalent atoms. An algorithm for determining the symmetry adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of atomic orbitals is also presented. The SALCs are constructed with the use of projection operators for the irreducible representations, as well as subgroups for determining splitting fields for a canonical basis. The character tables for the point groups are auto generated, and the algorithm is described. Symmetrisation of molecules use a projection into the totally symmetric space, whereas for wavefunctions projection as well and partner function determination and averaging is used. The software has been released as a stand-alone, open source library under the MIT license and integrated into both computational and molecular modelling software.},

	abstract = {In computational 3D geometric problems involving rotations, it is often that people have to convert back and forth between a rotational matrix and a rotation described by an axis and a corresponding angle. For this purpose, Rodrigues{\textquoteright} rotation formula is a very popular expression to use because of its simplicity and efficiency. Nevertheless, while converting a rotation matrix to an axis of rotation and the rotation angle, there exists ambiguity. Further judgement or even manual interference may be necessary in some situations. An extension of the Rodrigues{\textquoteright} formula helps to find the sine and cosine values of the rotation angle with respect to a given rotation axis is found and this simple extension may help to accelerate many applications.},
