\section{CONCLUSION}
In this article, we provide a framework in which a minimum set of tightbinding model
parameters are extracted for machine learning. Once these values are given, a 
nearest neighbor tightbinding Hamiltonian can be constructed that satisfy crystal 
symmetry. We also provide utilities to solve associated physical properties, such as 
electronic dispersion, density of states and transport properties. Our method 
allow for more than one order of magnititude reduction in numbers of required free parameters
while improving the accuracy of calculated properties by enforcing symmetry 
considerations. Our method is intended to be used with machine learning method but 
can be used as a helpful tools in general context when construction of a tightbinding model 
is of interest.
