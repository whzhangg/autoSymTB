	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08219},
	abstract = {We introduce tensor ﬁeld neural networks, which are locally equivariant to 3D rotations, translations, and permutations of points at every layer. 3D rotation equivariance removes the need for data augmentation to identify features in arbitrary orientations. Our network uses ﬁlters built from spherical harmonics; due to the mathematical consequences of this ﬁlter choice, each layer accepts as input (and guarantees as output) scalars, vectors, and higher-order tensors, in the geometric sense of these terms. We demonstrate the capabilities of tensor ﬁeld networks with tasks in geometry, physics, and chemistry.},
